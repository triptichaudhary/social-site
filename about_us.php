                                            A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on building and reflecting
                                            of social networks
                                            or social relations among people, who, for example, share interests and/or activities and
                                            people with similar or somewhat similar interests, backgrounds and/or activities make their
                                            own communities. A social network service consists of a representation of each user (often a profile),
                                            his/her social links, and a variety of additional services. Most social network services are web-based
                                            and provide means for users to interact over the Internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging. Online
                                            community services are sometimes considered as a social network service, though in a broader sense, social
                                            network service usually means an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered.
                                            Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual
                                            networks.
